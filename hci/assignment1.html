		<li>
			<h2>Banner Redesign</h2>
			<p>The current banner site is barely useable. My proposed solution would combine elements of the current system with a visual schedule element similar to those found on Schedulizer.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>National Grid Website</h2>
			<p>The National Grid website clearly hasn't been updated in years. Visually, the site shows its age, and the functionality of the site is unintuitive and confusing.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h2>MyNeu</h2>
			<p>The current layout is inefficient. The different sections of the page don't correspond with the links in the sections.</p>
